# Practicing Java Programming

Welcome to the **Practicing Java Programming** repository! This project contains a collection of Java programs and exercises that I have completed while learning and practicing the fundamentals of Java programming.

## Overview

This repository covers:

- **Basic Syntax**: Understanding Java's syntax and structure.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **Control Flow**: Using `if-else`, `switch`, loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`), and other control structures.
- **Data Structures**: Working with arrays, ArrayLists, LinkedLists, and HashMaps.
- **File Handling**: Reading from and writing to files using Java's I/O classes.
- **Exception Handling**: Managing errors using `try-catch` blocks, `throw`, `throws`, and custom exceptions.
- **Collections Framework**: Exploring Java's Collections Framework including Lists, Sets, Maps, and more.
- **Multithreading**: Implementing multithreading using the `Thread` class and the `Runnable` interface.


## Getting Started

To run the Java programs:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hansil-Chapadiya/JAVAPracticals.git
